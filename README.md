# Donut Hole

**mini version of the [Donut Dongle](https://github.com/svirant/DonutDongle) that enables auto profiles for RS-232 based switches for the RetroTink 4K Pro/CE**
 - 3DP case now available on [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1433467-donut-hole-for-retrotink-4k?from=search#profileId-1490991)
 - Compatible with the SVS
 - Connect multiple Donut Holes, Donut Dongles, gSerial Enablers simultaneously via a headphone jack splitter.
   - Must reflash "firmware" with offset variable set so SVS profile numbers don't overlap.
   - Up to 5 have been connected together simultaneously. More may be supported, but this is the max number I've been able to test.
 - Full instructions listed below for building your own!

> [!TIP]
> If DIY is not your thing. I have assembled versions available in my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/donutswdad/shop) shop.
</br>

> [!NOTE]
> *NEW* 0.4c update allows:
> <br /> 
>   - **front case buttons/remote NOW change profiles on the MT-VIKI HDMI switch.** Thanks to [Arthrimus](https://scalablevideoswitch.com/)!
>   - **auto-switching on Extron Matrix switchers** that support DSVP. Works with RGBS/HV and HDMI/DVI signal types.
>
> 
> <br /> For Matrix auto-switching, use the follow Options to enable:
> ```
> bool automatrixSW1 = true; // set true for auto matrix switching on "SW1" port
> bool automatrixSW2 = false; // set true for auto matrix switching on "SW2" port
> 
> int amSizeSW1 = 8; // number of input ports for auto matrix switching on SW1. Ex: 8,12,16,32
> int amSizeSW2 = 8; // number of input ports for auto matrix switching on SW2. ...
>
> uint8_t const vinMatrix[65] = {0,  // MATRIX switchers  // When auto matrix mode is enabled: (automatrixSW1 / SW2 above)
>                                                       // set to 1 for the auto switched input to trigger a Preset on SW1
>                                                       // set to 2 for the auto switched input to trigger a Preset on SW2
>                                                       // set to 3 for both SW1 & SW2
>                                                       // set to 0 to disable this feature (default - aka input goes to all outputs unless defined in voutMatrix)
>                                                       //

# Ordering PCBs
PCBs for this project:
 - [Donut Hole](https://github.com/svirant/DonutHole/blob/main/Donut_Hole.zip)
 - [VGA Adapter](https://github.com/svirant/DonutDongle/tree/main/Adapters) (VGAPassthrough or YC2VGA)
- (Optional) [TESmart_connector](https://github.com/svirant/DonutDongle/tree/main/Accessories)
- (Optional) [MT-VIKI / Extron / DB9 adapter](https://github.com/svirant/DonutDongle/tree/main/Accessories)
 
There are plenty of options for PCB manufacturing but I prefer [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) (No affiliation). Using the gerber (.zip) files provided, it's easy to place an order. Below are some tips/guidelines:
- 1.6mm Thickness
- For Surface Finish, "HASL(with lead)" is fine
- 4 Layer PCBs are the same cost as 2 Layer for the VGA Adapters. Because of that, the inner 2 layers are being used as ground planes for better EMI protection. Thanks to https://x.com/zaxour for the idea!
- "Remove Mark" option is now free on JLCPCB. Use it!
- All remaining default options should be fine
- Let me know if you have any questions!

# Programming an Arduino Nano
I recommend the [Official Arduino IDE and guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide) if you're unfamiliar with Arduinos. All .ino files used for programming are listed above. The following Library will also need to be added in order to Compile successfully.<br />
- **Libraries:**
  - <AltSoftSerial.h>  Follow these steps to add AltSoftSerial.h
    - Goto https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/AltSoftSerial
    - Click the GREEN "<> Code" box and "Download ZIP"
    - In Arudino IDE; goto "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .ZIP Library"

Some Arduino Nanos come with an Old Bootloader and won't Upload unless specified. **If you get errors** when trying to upload, swap to this option as a possible fix.

<img width="600" alt="bootloader" src="./images/2.png" />

## Steps to update offset
 - 1 - Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) for your PC or Mac
 - 2 - Click the green "<> Code" button above and "Download ZIP".
 - 3 - Extract the .zip file and open up the "Donut_Hole.ino" file in the Arduino IDE. It will ask if you would like to move this file inside a folder, select OK.
 - 4 - With the source code now open, select "Tools" -> "Board" -> "Arduino AVR Boards" -> "Arduino Nano"
 - 5 - Connect the Donut Hole device to your PC or Mac using the usb-c cable. You should see an LED light up when connected.
 - 6 - With the Donut Hole now connected, select it's "port" by going to "Tools" -> "Port", and select the port that starts with "/dev/cu.usbserial-" (on Mac) or "COM" if on PC.
 - 7 - Almost done! :) In the code itself, find the line that starts with "uint16_t const offset = 0;" and change the 0 to 300. It should now look like this: uint16_t const offset = 300;
   - This will give you profiles 301 - 399 for SW1 and 401 - 499 for SW2
   - At the moment this is line 32
 - 8 - From the menu at the top, select "Sketch" -> "Upload". You should see the LEDs on the Donut Hole flicker and a message that says "Done uploading." if successful.
   - If you get errors, see the section above about changing the "Bootloader" type.
 - 9 - Disconnect the usb-c cable from your computer and give it a whirl! You can repeat these steps in the future to make any other changes or update if a newer firmware is ever released.

# How to Use
- Make sure **"Auto Load SVS"** is **"On"** under the RT4K Profiles menu.  
- The RT4K checks the **/profile/SVS** subfolder for profiles and need to be named: **S\<input number>_\<user defined>.rt4**  For example, SVS input 1 would look for a profile that is named S1_SNES.rt4.  If there’s more than one profile that fits the pattern, the first match is used.

- Check the RT4K Diagnostic Console for Serial commands being received as confirmation.


## SVS Profile numbering scheme

**Input 1-10... = S1_ - S10_ ...,etc**

The "offset" option can be used if using multiple Donut Holes, gSerial Enablers, Donut Dongles are connected to the RT4K via a headphone splitter. For example, if using a 2nd, change "offset = 300" for the 2nd device to be SVS profiles 301 - 310.

```
uint16_t const offset = 0; // Only needed for multiple Donut Holes, gSerial Enablers, Donut Dongles. Set offset so 2nd, 3rd, etc gSEs don't overlap profiles. (e.g. offset = 300;) 
```
